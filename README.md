# Project Overview
This my project for Machine Learning Spring 2023

MovieLens, a movie recommendation service, has users enter which movie they recently liked, to get recommendations for a next movie to watch.

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning network, to propose which movie the user should watch next, as well as determine if a user will enjoy a given movie, based on previously watched/rated movies.
